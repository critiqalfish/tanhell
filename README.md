# tanhell

### wtf is this?
a custom background for X11 i made using two tanh(x) function plots that pulsate to create an animation.

### is this a good idea?
no, i am writing directly to the X11 root window using SDL2 which is not always best practise and may not work on every DE, although most simple background setters do it like this.

### where is this going?
nowhere, i am just insane.
